=head1 NAME

List::MoreUtils::Impl::Strict - Provide strict List::MoreUtils implementation (originally by Tassilo von Parseval)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use List::MoreUtils qw(:strict);

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 any BLOCK LIST

Returns a true value if any item in LIST meets the criterion given through
BLOCK. Sets C<$_> for each item in LIST in turn:

  print "At least one value undefined"
    if any { ! defined($_) } @list;

Returns false otherwise, or undef if LIST is empty.

=head2 all BLOCK LIST

Returns a true value if all items in LIST meet the criterion given through
BLOCK, or if LIST is empty. Sets C<$_> for each item in LIST in turn:

  print "All items defined"
    if all { defined($_) } @list;

Returns false otherwise, or undef if LIST is empty.

=head2 none BLOCK LIST

Logically the negation of C<any>. Returns a true value if no item in LIST meets
the criterion given through BLOCK, or if LIST is empty. Sets C<$_> for each item
in LIST in turn:

  print "No value defined"
    if none { defined($_) } @list;

Returns false otherwise, or undef if LIST is empty.

=head2 notall BLOCK LIST

Logically the negation of C<all>. Returns a true value if not all items in LIST
meet the criterion given through BLOCK. Sets C<$_> for each item in LIST in
turn:

  print "Not all values defined"
    if notall { defined($_) } @list;

Returns false otherwise, or undef if LIST is empty.

=head2 true BLOCK LIST

Counts the number of elements in LIST for which the criterion in BLOCK is true.
Sets C<$_> for  each item in LIST in turn:

  printf "%i item(s) are defined", true { defined($_) } @list;

=head2 false BLOCK LIST

Counts the number of elements in LIST for which the criterion in BLOCK is false.
Sets C<$_> for each item in LIST in turn:

  printf "%i item(s) are not defined", false { defined($_) } @list;

=head2 firstidx BLOCK LIST

=head2 first_index BLOCK LIST

Returns the index of the first element in LIST for which the criterion in BLOCK
is true. Sets C<$_> for each item in LIST in turn:

  my @list = (1, 4, 3, 2, 4, 6);
  printf "item with index %i in list is 4", firstidx { $_ == 4 } @list;
  __END__
  item with index 1 in list is 4
    
Returns C<-1> if no such item could be found.

C<first_index> is an alias for C<firstidx>.

=head2 lastidx BLOCK LIST

=head2 last_index BLOCK LIST

Returns the index of the last element in LIST for which the criterion in BLOCK
is true. Sets C<$_> for each item in LIST in turn:

  my @list = (1, 4, 3, 2, 4, 6);
  printf "item with index %i in list is 4", lastidx { $_ == 4 } @list;
  __END__
  item with index 4 in list is 4

Returns C<-1> if no such item could be found.

C<last_index> is an alias for C<lastidx>.

=head2 insert_after BLOCK VALUE LIST

Inserts VALUE after the first item in LIST for which the criterion in BLOCK is
true. Sets C<$_> for each item in LIST in turn.

  my @list = qw/This is a list/;
  insert_after { $_ eq "a" } "longer" => @list;
  print "@list";
  __END__
  This is a longer list

=head2 insert_after_string STRING VALUE LIST

Inserts VALUE after the first item in LIST which is equal to STRING. 

  my @list = qw/This is a list/;
  insert_after_string "a", "longer" => @list;
  print "@list";
  __END__
  This is a longer list

=head2 apply BLOCK LIST

Applies BLOCK to each item in LIST and returns a list of the values after BLOCK
has been applied. In scalar context, the last element is returned.  This
function is similar to C<map> but will not modify the elements of the input
list:

  my @list = (1 .. 4);
  my @mult = apply { $_ *= 2 } @list;
  print "\@list = @list\n";
  print "\@mult = @mult\n";
  __END__
  @list = 1 2 3 4
  @mult = 2 4 6 8

Think of it as syntactic sugar for

  for (my @mult = @list) { $_ *= 2 }

=head2 before BLOCK LIST

Returns a list of values of LIST upto (and not including) the point where BLOCK
returns a true value. Sets C<$_> for each element in LIST in turn.

=head2 before_incl BLOCK LIST

Same as C<before> but also includes the element for which BLOCK is true.

=head2 after BLOCK LIST

Returns a list of the values of LIST after (and not including) the point
where BLOCK returns a true value. Sets C<$_> for each element in LIST in turn.

  @x = after { $_ % 5 == 0 } (1..9);    # returns 6, 7, 8, 9

=head2 after_incl BLOCK LIST

Same as C<after> but also includes the element for which BLOCK is true.

=head2 indexes BLOCK LIST

Evaluates BLOCK for each element in LIST (assigned to C<$_>) and returns a list
of the indices of those elements for which BLOCK returned a true value. This is
just like C<grep> only that it returns indices instead of values:

  @x = indexes { $_ % 2 == 0 } (1..10);   # returns 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

=head2 firstval BLOCK LIST

=head2 first_value BLOCK LIST

Returns the first element in LIST for which BLOCK evaluates to true. Each
element of LIST is set to C<$_> in turn. Returns C<undef> if no such element
has been found.

C<first_val> is an alias for C<firstval>.

=head2 lastval BLOCK LIST

=head2 last_value BLOCK LIST

Returns the last value in LIST for which BLOCK evaluates to true. Each element
of LIST is set to C<$_> in turn. Returns C<undef> if no such element has been
found.

C<last_val> is an alias for C<lastval>.

=head2 pairwise BLOCK ARRAY1 ARRAY2

Evaluates BLOCK for each pair of elements in ARRAY1 and ARRAY2 and returns a
new list consisting of BLOCK's return values. The two elements are set to C<$a>
and C<$b>.  Note that those two are aliases to the original value so changing
them will modify the input arrays.

  @a = (1 .. 5);
  @b = (11 .. 15);
  @x = pairwise { $a + $b } @a, @b;	# returns 12, 14, 16, 18, 20

  # mesh with pairwise
  @a = qw/a b c/;
  @b = qw/1 2 3/;
  @x = pairwise { ($a, $b) } @a, @b;	# returns a, 1, b, 2, c, 3

=head2 each_array ARRAY1 ARRAY2 ...

Creates an array iterator to return the elements of the list of arrays ARRAY1,
ARRAY2 throughout ARRAYn in turn.  That is, the first time it is called, it
returns the first element of each array.  The next time, it returns the second
elements.  And so on, until all elements are exhausted.

This is useful for looping over more than one array at once:

  my $ea = each_array(@a, @b, @c);
  while ( my ($a, $b, $c) = $ea->() )   { .... }

The iterator returns the empty list when it reached the end of all arrays.

If the iterator is passed an argument of 'C<index>', then it returns
the index of the last fetched set of values, as a scalar.

=head2 each_arrayref LIST

Like each_array, but the arguments are references to arrays, not the
plain arrays.

=head2 natatime EXPR, LIST

Creates an array iterator, for looping over an array in chunks of
C<$n> items at a time.  (n at a time, get it?).  An example is
probably a better explanation than I could give in words.

Example:

  my @x = ('a' .. 'g');
  my $it = natatime 3, @x;
  while (my @vals = $it->())
  {
    print "@vals\n";
  }

This prints

  a b c
  d e f
  g

=head2 mesh ARRAY1 ARRAY2 [ ARRAY3 ... ]

=head2 zip ARRAY1 ARRAY2 [ ARRAY3 ... ]

Returns a list consisting of the first elements of each array, then
the second, then the third, etc, until all arrays are exhausted.

Examples:

  @x = qw/a b c d/;
  @y = qw/1 2 3 4/;
  @z = mesh @x, @y;	    # returns a, 1, b, 2, c, 3, d, 4

  @a = ('x');
  @b = ('1', '2');
  @c = qw/zip zap zot/;
  @d = mesh @a, @b, @c;   # x, 1, zip, undef, 2, zap, undef, undef, zot

C<zip> is an alias for C<mesh>.

=head2 uniq LIST

=head2 distinct LIST

Returns a new list by stripping duplicate values in LIST. The order of
elements in the returned list is the same as in LIST. In scalar context,
returns the number of unique elements in LIST.

    my @x = uniq 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 3, 4; # returns 1 2 3 5 4
    my $x = uniq 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 3, 4; # returns 5

=head2 minmax LIST

Calculates the minimum and maximum of LIST and returns a two element list with
the first element being the minimum and the second the maximum. Returns the
empty list if LIST was empty.

The C<minmax> algorithm differs from a naive iteration over the list where each
element is compared to two values being the so far calculated min and max value
in that it only requires 3n/2 - 2 comparisons. Thus it is the most efficient
possible algorithm.

However, the Perl implementation of it has some overhead simply due to the fact
that there are more lines of Perl code involved. Therefore, LIST needs to be
fairly big in order for C<minmax> to win over a naive implementation. This
limitation does not apply to the XS version.

=head2 part BLOCK LIST

Partitions LIST based on the return value of BLOCK which denotes into which
partition the current value is put.

Returns a list of the partitions thusly created. Each partition created is a
reference to an array.

  my $i = 0;
  my @part = part { $i++ % 2 } 1 .. 8;   # returns [1, 3, 5, 7], [2, 4, 6, 8]

You can have a sparse list of partitions as well where non-set partitions will
be undef:

  my @part = part { 2 } 1 .. 10;	    # returns undef, undef, [ 1 .. 10 ]

Be careful with negative values, though:

  my @part = part { -1 } 1 .. 10;
  __END__
  Modification of non-creatable array value attempted, subscript -1 ...

Negative values are only ok when they refer to a partition previously created:

  my @idx  = ( 0, 1, -1 );
  my $i    = 0;
  my @part = part { $idx[$++ % 3] } 1 .. 8; # [1, 4, 7], [2, 3, 5, 6, 8]

=head2 bsearch BLOCK LIST

Performs a binary search on LIST which must be a sorted list of values. BLOCK
must return a negative value if the current element (stored in C<$_>) is smaller,
a positive value if it is bigger and zero if it matches.

Returns a boolean value in scalar context. In list context, it returns the element
if it was found, otherwise the empty list.
